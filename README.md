# 2D Raycaster made in Processing

I realized a 2d Ray Caster for exercise using Processing.<br>
You can try it here: https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/747055. Use the mouse to move the origin of the rays and use clicks for change walls positions.<br>
<br>
These are some screenshot captured during the execution of the sketch:<br>
