# 2D Raycaster made in Processing

I realized a 2d raycaster for exercise using Processing and simple geometry formulas.<br>
You can try it here: https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/747055. Use the mouse to move the origin of the rays and click with it for changing the walls positions.<br>

These are some screenshot captured during the execution of the sketch:<br>
